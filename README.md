# kSharp
## A kerboscript IDE and compiler, featuring syntax and logic error detection.  

Ever spend hours painstakingly crafting a launch or mission script only to get to the launch pad, tell kOS to  run myScript.ks, and you get some obscure error, you cant clobber this or some 
such variable is not used or a parameter isnt quite right or whatever?  I have too and it pisses me off.  So i decided to build a simulator to test my guidance scripts for my simulated 
rockets and spacecraft.  The whole concept seems very Kerbal-ish to me.  I have built a simulated physics environment coupled to the compiler to run scripts to make sure they are 
sound and executable before I load them to my rockets.  

I have a few more features in mind that will be added soon, and I am open to suggestions or improvements.  hell, fork the thing and make it better.  just give me credit as creator.
